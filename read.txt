The project was an implementation based on the research paper we worked on. 

To run the project. The datasets need to be included in the same folder as the python scripts. And you need to execute all the notebook cells. 
the preprocessed data are in the same folder as the GloVe dataset used for the training so all you need to run each code is to run all the cells.
